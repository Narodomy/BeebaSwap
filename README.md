# Beeba Swap (Project 040613905)

This repository contains the source code for Beeba Swap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) project developed as part of the Blockchain class (040613905) taught by Professor TSR at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB) during my Bachelor's degree.

**Live Product:** [beeba-swap.github.io](https://beeba-swap.github.io/)

## About This Project

Beeba Swap is a practical implementation of blockchain concepts learned during the course. It demonstrates the fundamental principles of decentralized exchanges, including token swapping, smart contract interaction, and user wallet integration.

## Key Features

* **Decentralized Token Swapping:** Allows users to exchange tokens directly from their wallets.
* **Smart Contract Implementation:** Leverages smart contracts to automate and secure transactions.
* **Web3 Integration:** Connects to user wallets (e.g., MetaMask) for seamless interaction.
* **Educational Purpose:** Primarily developed for educational purposes, showcasing the practical application of blockchain technology.
* **[Add any other specific features you have here]**
